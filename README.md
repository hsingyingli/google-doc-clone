## Stack 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) : A JavaScript library for building user interfaces 
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs) : Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) : MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework
